# Virtual-Machine
##EOC-18
This was the final project in my Foundations of Computer Science class. The goal of the project was to build a complete virtual computer. This virtual machine has memory, instruction pointers, registers, as well as various different functions that a physical machine would have.
##What I learned
Over the course of this project, I learned a lot of about the individual components of a computer. The biggest takeaway from this project would be the overall scope of the assignment. This was completed periodically over the course of weeks. At first glance, this is a very large project, but if broken into segments, it becomes much more doable.
